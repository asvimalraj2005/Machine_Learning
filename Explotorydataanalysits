# In exploratory analysis we can study about three types namely bivariate,uninvariata amtiple variate=analysis
#  Uunivariate analyalssisis used to analyse  one variable 
# Bivariate analysis use of analyse into two variable. Tells how strongly does the correlation match Together or not get geild
# Multivariabte analysis and the that we can test as meany  coreelate many feature we we want
# 
# Understand what are needs that  are required to variate in any forms

# lineaer function 
# a linear function has one independent variabole(x) and dependent varubke (y) 
# fx-fxyax+b
# f(x) the output the dependedt variable
# x-the is input (independent variable)
#
#  it is a robust varaibale
# s-the input 
# ax = is the coefficient of the independent variable
