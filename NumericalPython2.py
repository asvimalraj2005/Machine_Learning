# Data Types in Python
# strings --> used to represent text data within double quotes where character can be wrapped around within single quotes 
# integer --> + infinity to - infinity
# float   --> decimal point numbers 
# boolean --> True or False will represented 
# complex --> Real number representation or complex number representation  -->  1.0 + 2.0 i

# Data Types in numerical python 
# Numerical python has some extra data types, and refer to data types with one character, like i for integers and, u for unsigned integers 
# There are lot of data types are there but only one type is used to create a numerical python array 
# i - integer              array contains -infinity values to +infinity values
# b - boolean              array contains 0's and 1's   -> 1 represents True and 0 represents False
# u - unsigned integer     array contains 32-bit datum that encodes a non-negative integer in the range [0 to 4294967295]
# f - float                array contains of decimal values 
# c - complex float        array contains of imaginary values 
# m - timedelta            array contains of data that have the duration between two events 
# M - datetime             array contains of data and time values (IDK )
# O - object               
# S - String
# U - unicode string
# V - fixed chunk of memory for other type (void )
