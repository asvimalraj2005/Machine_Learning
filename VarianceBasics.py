Variance is symbolically represented by σ2, s2, or Var(X). 
Var(X) = E[(X – E(X))2]

Var(X) = E[ X2 -2X E(X) +(E(X))2]

Var(X) = E(X2) -2 E(X) E(X) + (E(X))2

Var(X) = E(X2) – (E(X))2

Properties
The variance, var(X) of a random variable X has the following properties.

Var(X + C) = Var(X), where C is a constant.
Var(CX) = C2.Var(X), where C is a constant.
Var(aX + b) = a2.Var(X), where a and b are constants.
If X1, X2,……., Xn are n independent random variables, then 
Var(X1 + X2 +……+ Xn) = Var(X1) + Var(X2) +……..+Var(Xn).
Now let’s have a look at the relationship between Variance and Standard Deviation.

How to Calculate Variance
Variance can be calculated easily by following the steps given below:

Find the mean of the given data set. Calculate the average of a given set of values
Now subtract the mean from each value and square them
Find the average of these squared values, that will result in variance
Say if x1, x2, x3, x4, …,xn are the given values.

Therefore, the mean of all these values is:

x̄ = (x1+x2+x3+…+xn)/n

Now subtract the mean value from each value of the given data set and square them.

(x1-x̄)2, (x2-x̄)2, (x3-x̄)2,…….,(xn-x̄)2

Find the average of the above values to get the variance.

Var (X) = [(x1-x̄)2+ (x2-x̄)2+ (x3-x̄)2+…….+(xn-x̄)2]/n

Hence, the variance is calculated
